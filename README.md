# Pull request code reviewer using OpenAI's GPT

This code is designed to automate the process of reviewing pull requests on GitHub using OpenAI's language model. Here's a summary of what it does:

- Setup and Configuration: It imports necessary libraries and retrieves environment variables like GitHub token and OpenAI API key.

- Fetching Pull Request Details: It extracts details of the pull request being reviewed, such as the owner, repository, pull request number, title, and description.

- Retrieving the Code Diff: It retrieves the code changes introduced by the pull request in a unified diff format.

- Analyzing Code Changes: It analyzes the code changes in the pull request by parsing the diff and generating review comments using OpenAI's language model. These comments adhere to specific guidelines like not providing positive feedback, using Markdown format, and focusing only on code improvements.

- Creating Review Comments: It creates review comments based on the analysis and adds them to the pull request on GitHub.

Overall, this code automates the review process by generating constructive feedback on code changes in pull requests, helping maintain code quality and facilitating collaboration among developers. This is meant to supplement the review process by providing additional insights and suggestions for improvement based on the AI's analysis of the code changes. This is not meant to replace human code reviews but to enhance them by leveraging AI capabilities.
